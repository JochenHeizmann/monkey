# Module brl.databuffer

Databuffer objects provide storage for arbitrary data. 

For more information on databuffers, please refer to the [[DataBuffer]] class reference.


# Class brl.databuffer.DataBuffer

Databuffer objects provide storage for arbitrary data.

Data may be written to a databufffer using one of the 'poke' methods, and read from a databuffer using one of the 'peek' methods.

On the HTML5 target, there are some restrictions on how databuffers may be used:

+ Internet Explorer does not currently support databuffers.

+ On Firefox, peeks and pokes must be on 'naturally aligned' boundaries. PeekShort/PokeShort addresses must be a multiple of 2, and PeekInt/PokeInt/PeekFloat/PokeFloat addresses must be a multiple of 4.


# Method New(length:Int)

Creates a new data buffer of the specified byte length.

Values can be written into the databuffer using the various 'poke' methods, or read using the 'peek' methods.

## Parameters

length - buffer size, in bytes.


# Method Length:Int()

Returns the length, in bytes, of the data buffer.


# Method Discard:Void()

Releases any resources used by the data buffer.

Once discarded, a data buffer should not be used again.


# Method PokeByte:Void(address:Int,value:Int)

Writes an 8 bit byte into the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PokeShort:Void(address:Int,value:Int)

Writes a 16 bit int value into the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PokeInt:Void(address:Int,value:Int)

Writes a 32 bit int value into the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PokeFloat:Void(address:Int,value:Float)

Writes a 32 bit float value into the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

@address - byte address to poke

@value - value to poke


# Method PeekByte:Int(address:Int)

Returns the 8 bit byte contained in the databuffer at @address.

## Parameters

@address - byte address to peek.


# Method PeekShort:Int(address:Int)

Returns the 16 bit int value contained in the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

@address - byte address to peek


# Method PeekInt:Int(address:Int)

Returns the 32 bit int value contained in the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

@address - byte address to peek


# Method PeekFloat:Float(address:Int)

Returns the 32 bit float value stored in the data buffer at @address.

## Parameters

@address - byte address to poke

@value - value to poke


# Function Load:DataBuffer(path:String)

Creates and returns a databuffer containing the binary contents of the specified file.

If the file does not exist or cannot be read, null is returned instead.


## Parameters

@path - path of file to load.
