# Module mojo.app

# Import mojo.graphics Private

# Import mojo.input Private

# Import mojo.audio Private

The app module contains the App class along with various support functions for controlling application behaviour.


# Function LoadState:String()

Loads a string representing the application's persistant state as previously saved with SaveState.

If the application state hasn't yet been previously saved, LoadState returns an empty string.

This is generally used to store data such as user preferences and high score tables.

Note: On the android target, building and uploading a new version of an application to a device will not clear the application's state. To do this, you must manually uninstall the application from the device first.

[[SaveState]]

## Example

<pre>
'run this app several times to see application state being updated.
Import mojo.app
Import mojo.graphics

Class MyApp Extends App

	Field state$
	
	Method OnCreate()
	
		'comment out the following line to reset state
		state=LoadState()

		If state
			Print "state found - updating state!"
			state=Int( state )+1
		Else
			Print "state not found - creating initial state!"
			state="1"
		Endif
		
		SaveState state
	End
	
	Method OnRender()
		Cls 
		DrawText "state="+state,0,0
	End
	
End

Function Main()
	New MyApp
End
</pre>


# Function SaveState:Int(state:String)

Saves a string representing the application's persistant state.

This is generally used to store data such as user preferences and high score tables.

Note: On the android target, building and uploading a new version of an application to a device will not clear the application's state. To do this, you must manually uninstall the application from the device first.

## Parameters

state - application state to save.

[[LoadState]]


# Function LoadString:String(path:String)

Loads a string from path.

## Parameters

path - the data file path of the string to load, relative to your applications .data folder.


# Function SetUpdateRate:Int(hertz:Int)

Sets the application's update rate.

This is the number of times per second that the application's OnUpdate method should be called. Commonly used update rates are 15, 30 or 60 updates per second.

OnRender is also called at the same frequency if possible (after each OnUpdate), meaning SetUpdateRate effectively also sets the target frames per second.

## Parameters

hertz - update rate in 'updates per second'

## See also

[[App.OnUpdate|OnUpdate]], [[UpdateRate]]

## Example

<pre>
Import mojo.app
Import mojo.graphics

Class MyApp Extends App

	Field updates,updateRate

	Method OnCreate()
		updateRate=15
		SetUpdateRate updateRate
	End
	
	Method OnUpdate()
		updates+=1
		If updates=updateRate
			updates=0
			updateRate*=2
			If updateRate=240 updateRate=15
			SetUpdateRate updateRate
		Endif
		
	End
	
	Method OnRender()
		Cls 128,0,255
		DrawText "updateRate="+updateRate+", updates="+updates,0,0
	End
	
End

Function Main()
	New MyApp
End
</pre>


# Function UpdateRate:Int()

Returns the current update rate, as set by SetUpdateRate.

## See also

[[SetUpdateRate]]


# Function Millisecs:Int()

Returns the number milliseconds (thousandths of a second) the application has been running. Divide this by 1000.0 to get the number of seconds the applications has been running.

## Example

<pre>
Import mojo.app
Import mojo.graphics

Class MyApp Extends App

	Method OnCreate()
		SetUpdateRate 10
	End
	
	Method OnRender()
		Cls 128,0,255
		DrawText "Application has been running for: "+Millisecs()/1000.0+" seconds.",0,0
	End
	
End

Function Main()
	New MyApp
End
</pre>
