# Module brl.tcpstream

A tcpstream represents a TCP connection to a host on the internet.

Please see the [[TCPStream]] class reference for more information.

Note that TCP streams are only currently currently supported on the glfw, ios, android and stdcpp targets.


# Class brl.tcpstream.TCPStream Extends Stream

A tcpstream represents a TCP connection to a host on the internet.

After creating a tcpstream, you should use the [[Connect]] method to make a connection to a remote host.

Note that TCP streams are only currently currently supported on the glfw, ios, android and stdcpp targets.

Here is a simnple example of using a tcpstream to read the monkeycoder site home page:

<pre>
\#If TARGET\<\>"glfw"
\#Error "Please build with glfw target!"
\#Endif

Import brl.tcpstream

Function Main()

	Local stream:=New TCPStream
	
	If Not stream.Connect( "www.monkeycoder.co.nz",80 )
		Print "Failed to connect!"
		Return
	Endif
	
	Print "Connected!"
	
	stream.WriteLine "GET / HTTP/1.0"
	stream.WriteLine "Host: www.monkeycoder.co.nz"
	stream.WriteLine ""
	
	While Not stream.Eof()
		Local line:=stream.ReadLine()
		Print line
	Wend
	
	stream.Close
	
	Print "BYE!!!!"

End
</pre>


# Method Connect:Bool(host:String,port:Int)

Attempts to connect to the specified host and returns true if successful.

Once connected, you can use stream read/write commands to communicate with the host.
