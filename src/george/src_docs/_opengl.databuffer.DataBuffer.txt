# Class opengl.databuffer.DataBuffer

Databuffer objects provide storage for arbitrary data.

DataBuffer objects are most commonly used with opengl for specifying the contents of vertex buffer objects and texture images.

Note: On the HTML5 target, peeks and pokes must be on 'naturally aligned' boundaries. PeekShort/PokeShort addresses must be a multiple of 2, and PeekInt/PokeInt/PeekFloat/PokeFloat addresses must be a multiple of 4.


# Method Size:Int()

Returns the size, in bytes, of the data buffer.


# Method Discard:Void()

Releases any resources used by the data buffer.

Once discarded, a data buffer should not be used again.


# Method PokeByte:Void(addr:Int,value:Int)

Stores value into the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PokeShort:Void(addr:Int,value:Int)

Stores value into the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PokeInt:Void(addr:Int,value:Int)

Stores value into the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PokeFloat:Void(addr:Int,value:Float)

Stores value into the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Method PeekByte:Int(addr:Int)

Returns the 8 bit value contained in the databuffer at the given address.

The value is signed extended.

## Parameters

address - byte address to peek.


# Method PeekShort:Int(addr:Int)

Returns the short value contained in the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to peek


# Method PeekInt:Int(addr:Int)

Returns the int value contained in the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to peek


# Method PeekFloat:Float(addr:Int)

Stores value into the data buffer at address addr.

## Parameters

addr - byte address to poke

value - value to poke


# Function Create:DataBuffer(size:Int)

Creates and returns a new data buffer of the specified byte size.

Values can be written into the databuffer using the various 'poke' methods, or read using the 'peek' methods.

## Parameters

size - buffer size, in bytes.
