# The Flash target

Flash is a very popular web based platform by Adobe.

## You will need

* [Flex SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4) open source compiler tools from Adobe.

* [Java SE](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/widget/jdk6.jsp) development kit 6.

## Notes

The `FLEX_PATH` var in your [[Trans]] config file must be set correctly.

To modify the size and layout of Flash Monkey apps, you will need to modify the MonkeyGame.as file in your app's .build/flash directory.
